# SQL-Project-Data-Cleaning- Big Query
In this project, I utilized the 'ga_sessions' dataset provided by Google Data Studio. 
This dataset comprises data at the session-level pertaining to user interactions on a website, including metrics such as session duration, pages per session, bounce rate, as well as additional engagement metrics, and dimensions like user location and device type. 
Using this dataset, I analyzed metrics such as total visits, transactions, and bounce rates by traffic source to inform website optimization and marketing strategies.

1. Query 01: Calculate total visit, pageview, transaction for Jan, Feb and March 2017.
2. Query 02: Calculate bounce rate per traffic source in July 2017. 
3. Query 03: Revenue by traffic source by week, by month in June 2017.
4. Query 04: Average number of pageviews by purchaser type (purchasers vs non-purchasers) in June, July 2017.
5. Query 05: Average number of transactions per user that made a purchase in July 2017.
6. Query 06: Average amount of money spent per session. Only include purchaser data in July 2017
7. Query 07: Other products purchased by customers who purchased product "YouTube Men's Vintage Henley" in July 2017. Output should show product name and the quantity was ordered.
8. Query 08: Calculate cohort map from product view to addtocart to purchase in Jan, Feb and March 2017. For example, 100% product view then 40% add_to_cart and 10% purchase.
